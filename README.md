# GameEngine_Locus
##About
Locus is a simple game engine that I put together to make it more convenient for me to try and make games. This code library is built on code that was used for the BattlefieldCommanderGame and MeshSimulation programs that date back to a half a year ago. The feature list is very small, but it's enough to function.  One of these is a very simple 3D Graphics system, which rely on relative positions of coordinates and the camera to draw shapes and objects. Another feature is a basic framework for simulation-based programs that allows for somewhat accurate simulations, although processing power is a limitation that can affect performance. For more information, see the wiki, which will be created.
